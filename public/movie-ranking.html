<h2>Best 3 Anime List of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Re:Zero</h3>
<p>
    This is probably the best anime I got on my list since it is one of a kind of an anime, 
    where the main character gets to reset a part of his storyline every time he encounters death. 
    Once he accomplished that part of his life, he gets a new checkpoint to reset his death for the next one.
</p>
<h3>2. Demon Slayer</h3>
<p> 
    Demon Slayer is probably people's all time favorite as well because the graphic that this anime has, is definitely on the top tier list out there.
    A fair amount of sad moments and funny side jokes are implemented into the anime. Just a solid 9 out of 10 for me. 
</p>
<h3>3. Tokyo Revenger</h3>
<p>
    Coming in number 3, is Toko Revenger, similar to Re:Zero, the main character gets to change a part of his life in the past, only, to become a hoodlum.
    However, evertime he changes the past, it fabricates a new timeline and changes everything in the present time, 
    where his girl gets killed by the biggest mafia in town, Tokyo Manji Gang. 
    Therefore, he goes back and forth in the past and present time to make things better despite being the weakest member in the gang.
