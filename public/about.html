<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Just a brief Introduction about me, I am Jeffri, currently 23 years old, is working as a purchaser in Indonesia's largest mining industry, Tsingshan. So much about my work occupation,
 I've been to a lot of places around the world. As a matter of fact I've studied in Canada, Ontario, Hamilton for my college degrees in Columbia International College. And I've been to 
China for my bachelor degree in civil engineering.</p>

<p>I love to learn new things in life, yes, learning is probably my hobby, but don't get me wrong I hate studying! I think learning should be fun, and most importantly learning things need
  to be shown. I believe our culture of learning have always been a paperwork. I strongly disagree with students spending their young life just investing their time and effort into papers
  that is worth nothing. 
</p>

<p>The reason why I would like to learn about Web Development is to create a web or a software that can easen the things that I do in the future, perhaps, my work. I really look forward
  to the things I am going to learn in this course!
